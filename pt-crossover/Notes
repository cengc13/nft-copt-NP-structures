Pt nanoparticle structure motifs to study the crossover between three shapes, namely cubocahedron (in the folder './COh'), icosahedron ('./IOh'), and truncated octahedron ('./TOh').

For each shape, the trajectory files in the depth-2 folder are symmetric nanoparticles before relaxation, created using a DFT-calculated Pt lattice constant of 3.936 angstrom.
The trajectory files in the corresponding depth-3 folder and starting with 'opt_' are the relaxation trajectories using the force model.
The 'energy' text file saves the energy of the relaxed structure using the energy model.
The 'delta.txt' and 'avg_detal.txt' saves the respective maximum and average atomic uncertainties.
