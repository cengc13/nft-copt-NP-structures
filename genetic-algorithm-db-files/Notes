ASE-db files generated with genetic-algorithm runs for three structures.

- fcc111.db for a 80-atom Co-Pt fcc(111) surface

- fcc100.db for a 80-atom Co-Pt fcc(100) surface

- ptco-Ih-147.db for a 147-atom Co-Pt icosahedron

Also included are the configurations and trajectories of two types of Pt80Co67; one with Co occupying the corners of the surface and the other with the terrace centers of the surface.
Both structuresre are relaxed with the force ensemble model. The GPAW evaluated configurations with GPAW forces and energies are included.
