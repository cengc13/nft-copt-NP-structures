The initial 'rattled' structure is trajectory files without a predix 'opt_'. 
In terms of filenames, it start with the type of nanoparticle, followed by the stoichiometry of the nanoparticle.

The relaxation trajectories are trajectory files with a prefix 'opt'.

The file starting with 'delta' saves the structure uncertainty of the relaxed structure (maximum atomic force uncertainty), whereas the file starting with 'avg_delta' saves the average atomic force uncertainty.

The png files refer to the configuration of the Ih and COh nanoparticles.
